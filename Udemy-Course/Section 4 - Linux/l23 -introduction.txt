Hello and welcome to the Linux section.

Linux is the foundation on which DevOps and this entire course stands.

This is where your real technical strength begins.

If you're already a Linux administrator, you can skip this section.

But if you are not, then mastering this chapter is absolutely essential.

I have designed this section with one goal maximum efficiency.

You will learn a lot of Linux in a very short amount of time.

Quick, practical and focused on what truly matters for DevOps.

All right, let's take a look at what you will be learning.

Basics command like copying files, moving files, directories and stuff like that.

We'll understand Linux file systems and the text files.

Also how to edit the files, how to change the files, file permissions, stuff like that.

We'll see filters and redirection which I feel is a really very important topic for DevOps.

will see users and groups in Linux.

We'll see what is sudo and how to use it.

We'll see software management like RPM, Debian, yum, apt, etc. etc. we'll see services and processes

in Linux and we'll see a lot of commands which will be good to know being a DevOps or any Linux guy.

We'll be doing some server management, will be setting up web servers and database servers on our Linux

VMs.

So we'll be working basically in these four areas.

In Linux one will understand commands files softwares and servers.

And you should be really good in these four areas.

If you're in IT industry you must have already here.

You must have already heard the word open source.

If you are not aware about open source, you may generally think open source is about free.

Softwares with open source is much more than that.

And it's not just about free software.

Even some open source software are not free.

Well, I totally believe that today in the IT industry we have progressed so much because of open source

softwares.

Yes that's true.

If you go back and look at the open source history, you'll understand that most of the popular software

that you must be using is either open source or used to be open source.

So what really is open source?

Basically open source is the code freely available.

The code which was used to create the software.

That code is freely available for anybody to inspect, modify, enhance and then redistribute.

So if you're creating a software and you made it open source, you can expect people around the world

to contribute to your software, make it much more better and more secure.

More enhanced.

And that way, other people also become contributor to your open source project.

Now compare that with a software that is developed by an organization, a company where you have some

few brilliant heads, let's say 510 people working and creating a software.

Compare that with open source software, where you will be having hundreds or even thousands of people

contributing to a software.

So that's what open source software are.

It just doesn't mean it's free.

That's a common misconception.

Now Linux is an open source operating system or should I say open source kernel.

In 1984, the open source version of Unix utilities came in Unix I'm talking about, which was distributed

under GPL license in 1991, a guy named Linus Torvalds, who really changed everything in the IT industry.

Literally.

This brilliant mind created a Unix like kernel and made it open source.

He made the kernel open source.

It was a kernel which was similar to Unix.

Also ships with it some new utilities.

The tools.

And after that, brilliant minds around the world started using that kernel, which is called Linux

kernel, and started developing some utilities around it to create a complete operating system.

So in today's time when you talk about Linux operating system like CentOS or Ubuntu or Kali Linux or

Debian or Red Hat Linux, they are using the Linux kernel.

Of course, it's upgraded now.

So let's say Red hat has took that kernel and created its own utilities packaging system and created

a complete operating system, which we call it as Red Hat Linux.

And there are Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS Linux, fedora Linux same way canonical created ubuntu.

Then you have Debian, then you have open source.

And now there are lots and lots of Linux operating system in Android phone is Linux.

So it all happened because of Linus Torvalds, who gave us the Unix like kernel, which we call it as

Linux kernel.

Let's see some Linux principles which are very important for anyone to understand.

And especially for DevOps, Linux everything is considered as a file, including the hardware, your

mouse, your keyboard, printer.

Everything will be considered as a file by Linux operating system.

And we can literally see that file.

And when I say file, it just doesn't mean the text file.

It could be any other file, which we will understand later.

In Linux we have small single purpose program.

We don't have bulky programs.

We do have, but very rarely.

Mostly we have small single purpose programs, and there will be an ability to change these programs

together to perform complex operations.

You know, that may really sound similar to continuous delivery, continuous integration where we have

small programs, small automation, we combine them together to perform more complex pipeline operations.

We avoid captive user interface in Linux.

That means we don't like the graphical software's next, next, next finish done right.

We know if you open a software or any tool and it is waiting for user input, that means it has captured

the user interface.

The user has to be there and click or write something so the program can continue.

We are going to avoid that in this course also.

And being a DevOps also, you should avoid those things.

Otherwise it's difficult to run things in the background or automate such things.

Configuration.

Configuration data are stored in text file in Linux, which is very good.

Being a DevOps for us so we can very easily make changes to the files.

We don't need to go to like say settings and tabs and advanced tab.

Right.

So very easily we can change settings.

So why Linux.

I mean it's a really very broad question.

Why Linux for DevOps or why Linux for server or why Linux at all?

Okay, first of all it's open source.

Okay.

So you get huge community support.

You get new new updates.

It supports wide variety of hardware.

Now you must have already seen that.

You know it runs on your phone.

It runs on your laptop, it runs on your server.

And different, different other hardwares of the servers or desktops.

And there's a lot of customization you can do in Linux operating system.

Most of the servers out there are running Linux operating system.

Even some of the very popular supercomputers.

Automation is so easy to do it on Linux compared to, let's say, windows.

Now windows is also catching up.

Now you have PowerShell and you know, new, new things are coming up.

But when it comes to Linux, there are many, many, many ways to automate.

One thing in Linux.

And Linux is considered as a secure operating system compared to Microsoft Windows.

But that could be debatable topic and I would leave that up to you.

Okay.

Let's see.

Architecture of Linux a high level view.

Very simple.

You have the hardware which is your compute resource, your Ram, CPU network.

Right.

That's compute resource hardware.

On top of that there will be kernel.

Now in your Linux operating system you have Linux kernel, which will read or understand the hardware

and can pass signal through to and fro to your hardware.

To shell from shell, you can execute commands and expect a return.

And you should also have a lot of tools built around your Linux kernel, which you can use starting

from very simple commands like CD or VI or Cat or RLS to all the way to graphical software's.

Also like browsers readers like PDF readers.

So user will connect to these tools, which in turn will send the information to the kernel.

And that's the kernel that Linus Torvalds has developed.

Okay.

Let's see some popular Linux distros on the desktop side.

Desktop.

Like if you want to install it on your laptop or on your desktop.

Some popular name they really changes, you know.

Uh, usually the most popular one is Ubuntu Linux or Linux Mint.

You know, or you can just Google top ten Linux distros, right?

You will find that the latest one.

And again you have your own preference.

Also Ubuntu Linux is the most popular one.

Then you have Linux Mint, which is also very easy to use.

Arch Linux you have Fedora Linux, you have from Red hat, and then you have Debian and Open Source.

So you can try and use this operating system on your laptop.

I really recommend you do dual boot, and you use Linux operating system as much as possible for your

desktop needs.

And that way you will become very comfortable with Linux systems.

So these are desktop but we are focusing more on server.

So popular server Linux operating system.

The most popular name is Red Hat Enterprise Linux which is obviously from Red hat.

This is considered as the most stable and secure Linux operating system and it is not open source.

There is licensing for it.

Then you have Ubuntu Server, which is open source and quite popular.

And my personal favorite, I would say this is the easiest Linux operating system, but some people

will disagree with that in terms of security.

And we will discuss that.

Then you have centaurs, which is similar to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but it is open source.

Centaurs and Rachel are almost similar, but centaurs is open source.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux is not.

Then you have Suse Enterprise Linux.

You have a few more names, but these are the popular ones.

Now I will take you to Wikipedia to show you the list of all the Linux operating systems we have today.

So you can open this site.

List of Linux distribution in Wikipedia.

So you have first the RPM based and then you have Debian based.

Then you have Pacman based Gentoo based.

These are different different packaging methods.

So RPM based Red Hat Linux centaurs.

Fedora open source.

Open source is also uh RPM based in CentOS again Clearos.

Miracle Linux.

Oracle Linux, which is Oracle Linux, is similar to Red Hat Enterprise Linux Amazon Linux will be using

Amazon Linux also when you start using EC2 instances.

Fedora based you have a lot of names you have there.

Open source based you have.

These are popular names.

Okay, if you are just still in the very upper side of the page, Debian based backtrack, which I don't

think it's anymore.

You have Kali Linux.

This is used by the penetration testers ubuntu.

Then you have kubuntu, Lubuntu, xubuntu, edubuntu.

These are all ubuntu based and Ubuntu is Debian based, so it's similar to Debian operating system.

Linux elementary OS which I used for desktop.

It was nice like Mac OS, Linux Mint.

You have many, many, many, many operating systems.

Linux operating system.

You can keep scrolling and reading about them.

So why I'm showing you all this.

It's really I want to show you the scale of Linux operating system.

The flavors.

These are called flavors of Linux.

So there are many, many Linux flavors out there.

Like also your Android is Linux, so I don't want you confuse more with many, many Linux operating

system.

But I want to show you there are many available.

But if you're working in IT industry you will see two popular names.

One is RPM based and the other one is Debian based RPM based.

You have Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Oracle Linux, and now you also have Amazon Linux which

is on AWS, and then you have Debian based Ubuntu Server, Kali Linux.

And there are many, many, many names in Debian operating system.

The major difference between these two family of operating system is the packaging method of the software.

That's where the difference start.

RPM based means you have a software which is packaged in RPM format like you have.

Exe msi apk like that this RPM and deb for Debian.

So before I make you understand the difference between these two family, let me tell you which one

will be used when.

So Red hat is considered as stable and secure operating system, especially Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

You cannot download and install.

I mean, you should not download and install software in Oracle Linux from outside.

You download it only from Red hat repository.

So Red hat is going to test all the softwares and packages before it releases it to its users.

Like same like Apple.

Okay.

Which will test the softwares very thoroughly for any security or for any performance flaw.

But then you have Debian based here.

You get lots and lots of softwares very easily, very easy to install, very easy to set up.

It focuses more on user friendliness.

So if you need latest and greatest and open source software, you go with Debian based like ubuntu.

So I'll tell you my personal preferences.

If you want to run servers, I will prefer RedHat operating system if I want to use it for DevOps.

For some automation purpose, I will be using ubuntu because I may need latest and greatest libraries

and softwares to do some automation.

And I don't want to get into software installation problems, so I'll prefer Debian based for DevOps

purpose and Red hat based for server based.

Again, it's your choice, but you can do either of it on any of the operating system.

There is no hard and fast rule, but that's a general mentality.

So these two popular family are used in IT industry.

RPM based or Debian based.

Again, as I said there will be packaging difference first to start with.

But then there are more command differences.

So RPM base will have software that ends with RPM, and Debian will have software that ends with Deb.

So Debian software, let's say you want to install Google Chrome.

So package name will be something like this.

Google Chrome, some blah blah blah version dot deb.

If you install it the command will be dpkg hyphen I and the package name.

Sure, there are many ways of installing a software in Ubuntu or Debian, but this is a very manual

way.

If.

Same thing.

If you want to install Google Chrome on a red hat machine, then you will have software named Google

Chrome, some version dot rpm, Red hat package manager and to install the command will be different

rpm hyphen I've there we have dpkg hyphen I.

So you see the packaging is different.

So then the commands are also different.

Then their file names will be different.

Like that you will see many many differences.

Then in our day to day life we will see difference between commands.

So being DevOps you should be comfortable in any Linux operating system.

Okay, now let's get started with basic commands of Linux.

But before we do that, one last thing.

We'll understand the directory structure in Linux.

We'll log into the Linux VM's Linux operating system and see all these directories.

But to get started with some important directories home directories.

Every user in Linux will have its home directory.

Now directory means really folders.

If you are from windows background you'll call them as folders.

But now we call them as directories.

Root user is the admin user.

All powerful user in Linux and its home directory will be root.

A normal user's home directory will be slash home slash user name like vagrant user.

The home directory will be slash home slash vagrant user executable commands.

Generally you know the commands that we are running Linux cat pwd.

These commands will be located in slash bin or slash user slash bin.

Or you can have them placed into slash usr local bin.

These commands will be executed by normal user, but for root user the commands will be located in slash

bin.

These commands can be executed by root user like installing a software rpm command or dpkg command,

or m or apt command, or adding a user like user add command.

So such kind of system admin commands will be located in slash sbin or slash usar slash sbin.

Or you can create your own commands in usr local bin.

If you connect some external device like USB drive or CD, it will be automatically mounted either on

slash media or slash configuration data will be stored in slash, etc. and this is where we're going

to spend a lot of time like network configuration, server configuration.

User configuration.

Although configuration most of the configuration will be in UTC.

Any temporary data you want to keep it will be you can put it in slash temp.

It's temporary and there's a chance of that getting deleted when you reboot, so be careful with that.

Kernel and bootloader is located in slash boot server data here also will spend a lot of time slash

slash var or slash SV like websites web server you are running.

So website files you're going to put them into slash var HTML, something like that.

Or MySQL data var lib mysql directory okay.

So mostly the server data will be in this directory system information will be stored in slash proc

or slash SSIS.

Popular libraries will be stored in slash lib usr lib or usr local lib.

Okay now let's get into our Linux machine, our VMs and see all this directory structure.
