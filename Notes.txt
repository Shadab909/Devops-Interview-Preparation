## Vagrant Box Setup

1) search for the box name from vagrant cloud
2) on gitbash
  vagrant init boxname (downloads and creates the vm and boots it up)
  Note :  if gave wrong name, edit name in vagrant file in the path
3) lecture-flow:-
  vagrant up (after init try to check status or do ssh without up)
  vagrant box list
  vagrant status
  vagrant ssh (login vm)
  sudo -i (switch from vagrant user to root user)
  vagrant halt (poweroff the vm)
  vagrant up (power up)
  vagrant reload (reboot, it read all chnages to vag file and apply them except for box name chnage for that if you chnage the box name , delete exiting box and recreate)
  vagrant destroy (delete the vm)
  vagrant status (not craeted) , file is still there
  vagrant up (now its creating the vm as if was deleted. It will import the box already present in the box, no re-download)
  vagrant box list ( shows all box)
  vagrnat halt (shut down vm)
  
  now ubuntu vm (go to ubuntu folder)
  serach for ubuntu box (ubuntu jammy 64
  vagrnat inti box name
  vagrnat up
  vagrant status (status of vm in that pwd)
  vagrant global-status (status of all vm's status)
  vagrant global-status --prune (confusion )
  vagrnat ssh (login to ubuntu)
  sudo -i (from vagrant to root user)
  vagrant halt (poweroff ubuntu vm)
  
  Note: poweroff the vm them power off your personal computer
  
## Linux Section

cat /etc/os-release
sudo -i
type cd and hit Enter, then you'll come back
whenever you're lost, you can do cd and hit Enter.
cd / & ls -lrth
you should see here, a /root that is the root user's home directory.
a /home directory inside that you'll have users' home directories.
/etc for configuration 
/boot directory where you have bootloader and kernel
/media /mnt for mound points 
/opt, it's an optional directory
home directory /root for root user, normal user /home/username.
User executable is in /bin
Absolute path always begins with the root directory

/bin, if you do ls, you should see a lot of files. These are mostly the user executable programs like mv, is to move files, scp to copy files to remote Linux machines, yum, and you'll see many more.

/sbin, these are the programs that are executable by root user like for example, mkfs.ext4, this is for formatting partition, which cannot be done by the normal user, reboot command, to reboot your operating system. This can be executed by normal user also, provided you give sudo and many other system executable commands

hostname is store in /etc/hostname but mine one is empty , for me its stored at /proc/sys/kernel/hostname 


Yum configuration in /etc which is the package manager in Red Hat machine.

Networks configuration and so many other configuration files in /etc.

Temporary files, /tmp.

many automation tools when they're doing some operation, they need some files for temporary purpose, they'll use /tmp directory.
