Instructor: Software management

or in Linux we call them as package management.

In your life you must have installed

or uninstalled many softwares on your computer,

on your smartphone,

or any other software based devices.

In Linux there are many different ways

of installing or setting up a package.

So we are going to start from very basic

of how to download and install a single package,

and then we'll slowly move to package management tools

like Yum, DNF, APT.

In the very beginning we created two VMs,

one CentOS, the other, Ubuntu.

The major difference between these two operating system

is the package management system.

CentOS is RPM based OS,

and Ubuntu is Debian based OS.

We will understand its difference now.

So log into your VM, the CentOS VM.

If it's not up, bring it up and just do vagrant ssh.

Okay, we are going to switch to root user.

So do sudo -i,

because managing package is root user task

or you need to have root user privilege for that.

Okay, let's first run this command cat /etc/os-release.

Read this file.

Here, you should see ID="centos", or ID_LIKE="rhel_fedora."

CentOS, RHEL Fedora,

these are all RPM based operating system.

Also if your OS is RPM based,

this command should work, rpm -qa.

This should list all the RPM packages installed

on your computer.

And if Debian based, you should be able

to run the command dpkg -l.

But this command won't work, because this is RPM based OS.

Anyways, we'll see this command in a moment.

So let's clear the screen.

Okay, so let's learn installing software by an example.

So I'm going to run here a command called telnet.

Now don't worry about what this command does.

We're going to learn this in detail in networking lecture,

but telnet is a very popular command.

It is used for network troubleshooting,

and if I run this command,

I get an error, no such file or directory,

or you might get an error, command not found.

But telnet is definitely a command and it should work.

If it's not working,

that means its package is not installed.

In CentOS we can simply call it as RPM.

There is no Telnet RPM installed. So how do we install it?

So we are going to search for Telnet RPM on the internet.

We just say telnet rpm.

And you should get many repositories.

Repositories are the places where the packages are kept.

So you have Rpmfind, very popular,

you have centos.package.org, very popular,

rpm.pbone.net, that is also very popular.

We are going to use Rpmfind, because it's very clean.

Just click on Rpmfind.net,

or you can simply go to the URL Rpmfind.net, like that also.

And you can put your RPM name, Telnet, and make a search.

So it gives you the list and the link to download the RPM.

But there are many. Which one do we choose?

So one thing we know, we have CentOS operating system.

CentOS 9, we can search for, and we see here CentOS 9.

But again you have then different other architecture,

aarch64, ppc, s390x, x86_64.

Now to find the architecture of your operating system,

you can run arch command.

So let's go to the terminal and run the command arch,

and you should see the architecture.

There's another command, uname -m,

that also gives you the architecture.

Now architecture is of the CPU, and if you have 64-bit CPU,

you're going to install 64-bit OS.

And likewise you're going to install 64-bit packages.

So we want to install Telnet RPM for CentOS Stream 9

for x86_64, so right click, Copy link address.

Now we want to download it in the Linux shell.

If we click on this, it is just going

to download in our local machine,

but we want to download it

in our Linux OS through the command line.

So we are going to run a command called curl.

Think of curl as the text based browser.

So you say curl, paste the link,

and then you have to say -o, output, store this output,

and you need to give the output file name.

So we're going to give the same name of the RPM

as it is, copy and paste.

So it's going to go to this link

and store all the output in this file.

Okay, let's hit Enter.

If you do ls, you should see the RPM,

and to command to install the RPM is

rpm -i, is to install, v is for verbose, that means print,

h is for human readable format.

So it's going to install and print everything

in human readable format.

And you need to give the path of where your RPM is located.

So it's in current directory.

So simply give the name and hit Enter.

Okay, so the RPM is installed.

Now if we run the command telnet, we get the Telnet shell.

Now as I said, what is Telnet and all?

That we'll see in the networking lecture.

You can simply quit from here.

You can find from the list also, rpm -qa | grep,

search for telnet.

So if Telnet is installed or not,

you can see like this with this command.

And if you want to uninstall, remove this RPM,

you have to give rpm -e is to erase,

and you have to give this name,

what you find through rpm -qa command, and then hit Enter.

It should remove that RPM.

And if you run telnet command, you'll again get the error.

Now this is a very basic method of finding the RPM

and installing it, but Linux

gives much more better package management systems or tools.

For example Yum, DNF, APT.

And majority of the time, you will be using them.

And how and when to use them?

Let's understand that by example.

So let's say now I want to install a package called httpd.

Let me come here, Rpmfind, and let's search for httpd.

It's one of the most popular web service,

and we're going to learn this later.

We have so many use cases for httpd,

but since we're talking about packages,

let's focus on that here first.

So httpd RPM, I want to install,

and we know now httpd for CentOS Stream 9 x86_64.

Right click, Copy link address, go to your terminal.

Okay, let me clear the screen. Now you've seen curl command.

I'll show you one more command to download, wget.

Wget, and just paste the URL, and hit Enter.

So wget or curl can access a remote URL,

but wget is most of the time used

to download something from a remote URL.

Curl has many other use cases.

So you can use wget if you just want to download.

So we have the httpd RPM and we know how to install it,

rpm -ivh, sorry, -ivh, and give the package name.

Okay, so this is the problem with RPM.

It simply tries to install the software,

but the software may have many dependencies.

Here you just see two,

but there could be 20, hundreds, of dependencies.

In that case, you need to install those dependencies first

and then you can install your package.

And trust me, I did those things

in my old system admin days.

It's a very hectic process.

So we have package management tools like Yum.

Okay, let me clear the screen here.

I'm going to go to the folder /etc/yum.repos.d/,

and I do ls here.

And you will see some files over here.

You'll see two or maybe more files in your VM.

These files, let's do a cat

to one of the files, centos.repo,

any of the files, you just do a cat, read that file.

And here you will see repositories.

So this is the URL of the repository, that's the name,

and a few other information

whether it's enabled or not, like that.

This is one section, one repository, you can say.

Second repository, like that, many repositories.

So default repository access comes

with the operating system when you install the OS.

Some you can add to get access to more softwares.

So the way it works is, let me once again clear the screen.

I will say yum search httpd.

And it is going to search

through all the available repositories

and give me the list of all the packages

that has the name httpd.

See here, so many packages that has the name httpd,

httpd-devel, httpd-filesystem, httpd-manual.

I'm just interested in installing this one.

So I will say yum install httpd.

And when I hit Enter, so it says architecture,

you know, x86_64.

That's the package it is installing,

and it's installing dependencies.

So all the dependencies and some of the weak dependencies.

If you're okay with this, you can say yes.

So total 11 packages will be installed.

So y for yes, hit Enter.

Just going to go through those repositories, download it

and install it, and set it for you.

Imagine downloading,

installing all those RPMs one by one manually.

It's going to take time.

Now a new generation tool is DNF for RPM based OS.

So you can also say dnf install httpd.

That also you can do.

Since everything is installed

and dependencies are all resolved,

there's no dependencies required,

so it is saying nothing to do.

So you can use Yum or DNF.

Alternatively, most of the time try to use DNF.

It's a new generation commands.

You can remove it by saying dnf remove httpd, right?

So it's also removing unused dependency.

It's only going to remove the dependency if it's unused,

if it's not used by any other package.

And y, okay?

You can also just say, yeah,

dnf install -y if you're sure it's not even going

to ask you a question, you can just say -y.

And no yes or no question, simply download it

and all the dependencies with it.

Okay, there are many other amazing options available

with the DNF or Yum.

I just say dnf --help to see the available options.

Like Yum, or dnf check-update, clean,

there is install, list, reinstall.

It's also useful sometimes while installing packages,

for some reason it doesn't get installed properly,

so you can say reinstall also to reinstall it.

Remove, we have seen.

Yum upgrade or dnf upgrade will upgrade a package

or all the packages in your system.

So let me show you that, yum upgrade if you do.

So it is saying total 161 packages needs to be upgraded,

six new packages will be installed.

You can see all the list, right?

It's like you update softwares

on your phone or computer, right?

Like that similar way, yum upgrade.

So it's gonna take some time.

We are not going to install it, just say no.

But in real time when you set any new OS,

when you start using it,

before you start using it, you upgrade it.

So you know, it patches all the vulnerabilities

and you know, bug fixes, right?

Okay, so we have seen how to install RPM, we have seen how

to install it through Yum, DNF.

Now let's say if we are trying to install a package

and it's not available through Yum, also.

I'll say yum install jenkins.

We will be using Jenkins a lot in this course.

It's a continuous integration tool.

So let's say I'm trying to install that,

yum install jenkins, and that's the package name.

It says no match for argument, jenkins.

That means this Jenkins package is not available

in any of the repositories that it has access to.

And that is from here, yum.repos.d, right?

None of the file here has the access

to a repository that has the package, jenkins.

So it is simply giving you that error, unable to find.

So then what do you do? Well, it's pretty simple.

You open your browser, Google or any search engine,

and you say install jenkins.

So the vendor, right, Jenkins, is going to give you steps

of how to install a particular package,

if it's package, like installing Jenkins.

You see? jenkins.io, that's the URL over there.

Let's click on that, and we're installing it on Linux.

So over here click on Linux.

And in Linux, you have here Debian, Ubuntu flavor,

Fedora, Red Hat, Alma, Rocky.

So that's what we want. Let's click on that, right?

All right, yeah, you can install Jenkins through Yum

on Red Hat Linux, Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, Oracle Linux.

Same goes for CentOS.

Okay, so let's come down,

and here, you should see the commands of installing Jenkins.

Here you see the yum install command, Jenkins,

but before that you have few other commands.

Let's go through them.

So wget -o, that means output into this file,

and this is the URL.

So it's going to basically go to this URL

and all the output is going to store into this file.

It is going to create a file, jenkins.repo,

which will have the repository information.

Then it is running a command rpm --import.

And this is the path of a key.

So some repositories need keys to access.

So it is giving you the command to import the key,

then yum upgrade to upgrade all the packages.

And then some dependency.

Now Jenkins depends on Java 17 and fontconfig.

That's one dependency.

Install that dependency and then install Jenkins.

And don't worry about this command,

we'll understand this later.

So let's do this one by one. Let's copy this command.

This is one command divided into two with a backward slash.

Let me copy this, and let's paste it here.

So if you want to give command in multiple lines,

you can separate it by a backward slash, like that.

Okay, so it created a file there.

We can just do a cat to this file.

See that? The package information is stored.

Repository information is stored over here.

And then we run this command

to copy the key, the access key.

Okay, that is done. And next is doing yum upgrade.

Now that's optional, but you know what? Let's do this.

Now this might take some time for some people,

because of the internet.

For me it will be super quick. I just say y.

And it's done.

I told you it's going to be super quick for me.

You know why? Because I paused the recording.

I know that's not an option for you, anyways.

So you learn, you know, if you are not able

to find a package in your repository from your OS,

you can anyway search on the internet.

The vendor who releases the package will also

give you information of how to install it.

So do not worry about installing packages.

It's going to be always the easiest thing

that you do in Linux.

But you need to understand the mechanism behind it

to find out the right package for you, for your OS,

for your architecture.

Okay, so for now, just go through the list

of options available for DNF.

There are some regularly used one, you don't need

to mug up this, just know

that you can anytime do dnf --help

and find out all the option.

So you've seen how to install a package.

We have here, you know, where there is a reinstall option,

remove, update, dnf grouplist.

You have group packages also,

like a developer's development tools group.

And you can install group packages with group install.

You have DNF repository list, dnf repolist.

And you see the list of all the repositories.

You see we have Jenkins repository also available.

dnf clean all or yum clean all, is

to clean the cache, clear the cache.

Sometimes you need to do that,

because let's say you have added the repository,

but still not able to install sometimes

due to the caching issue, you can do dnf clean all,

and then again you can do yum install or dnf install.

It will again scan the repository.

One more popular package, and let me tell you, epel-release.

Just do dnf install epel-release -y.

If you install this package,

it is going to give you access to more repositories.

Okay, let me clear the screen.

Let me show you that command once again.

This is the package name.

This is for RPM based, mostly CentOS, Alma Linux.

These kinds of OS, epel-release.

If you do dnf repolist, you get access to new repositories.

And lastly, let me show you dnf history.

That will show you what all we did with DNF

or Yum command.

So install httpd, we removed it,

upgrade, epel-release install.

All right? So there are many other available options.

Use it when you need it.

Don't try to mug up all those things.

We will be using these commands a lot in this course.

You don't even need to really, you know, mug up them.

You can just, it will be always in the back of your head.

Okay, so we will be doing more lectures on packages

after we do services and processes.

That would be all in this lecture.

Make sure you run the history command

and see the list of all the commands

that we have executed in this lecture.

Thank you so much for watching and practicing.

I'll see you in the next lecture.
