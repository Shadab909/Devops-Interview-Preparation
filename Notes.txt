## Vagrant Box Setup

1) search for the box name from vagrant cloud
2) on gitbash
  vagrant init boxname (downloads and creates the vm and boots it up)
  Note :  if gave wrong name, edit name in vagrant file in the path
3) lecture-flow:-
  vagrant up (after init try to check status or do ssh without up)
  vagrant box list
  vagrant status
  vagrant ssh (login vm)
  sudo -i (switch from vagrant user to root user)
  vagrant halt (poweroff the vm)
  vagrant up (power up)
  vagrant reload (reboot, it read all chnages to vag file and apply them except for box name chnage for that if you chnage the box name , delete exiting box and recreate)
  vagrant destroy (delete the vm)
  vagrant status (not craeted) , file is still there
  vagrant up (now its creating the vm as if was deleted. It will import the box already present in the box, no re-download)
  vagrant box list ( shows all box)
  vagrnat halt (shut down vm)
